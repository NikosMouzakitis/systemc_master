                PKtool Class Library (Rel. 2.3.0)
                =======================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              

1. This is the 2.3.0 release of the PKtool Class Library.
   This release includes resources for transaction level power analysis. These 
   capabilities are targeted to applications on systems modelled through the TLM 2.0 
   extension of SystemC. 
   To enable transaction level power analysis, it is necessary to uncomment the macro 
   PK_TLM_ENABLED defined in the header file 'pk_settings.h' inside the directory 
   src/PKtool/kernel. After doing that, build the PKtool library. 
   

    
2. Some bugs present in the previous releases have been fixed.
   Nonetheless, further verification and testing phases should be carried out to 
   make more stable and efficient the future PKtool releases.
	
	
3. This release is supported on the following platforms for which it has been 
   well tested:
    
   
  o Windows 7 SP1 (WoW64)  
   - MS Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition and SystemC 2.3.1
    
  o Windows 7 SP1 (WoW64), (Cygwin 1.7.17)
   - GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-4.9.2
