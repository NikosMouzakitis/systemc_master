README for fir
===================================================================


This example shows the application of PKtool onto a SystemC description 
called "fir", which has been taken from the examples provided by the 
SystemC 2.3.1 release. More precisely, the fir example is located in the release directory 
examples\sysc\fir. In such directory it is possible to find a readme file
reporting a complete documentation of the system and its functionality.

The fir example is originally based on two possible system implementations; we can refer
to them as "fir_module" and "fir_fsm". The first one is constituted by a single
sc_module realizing the whole functionality. The second implementation is an FSM-based  
architecture constituted by a top_level sc_module wrapping two sub-modules, a datapath   
unit (fir_data) and a control unit (fir_fsm).
In this example, PKtool is applied onto the two fir implementations with different
modalities. In the case of fir_module, the sc_module representing the whole system
is configured for PKtool simulations by definiting and instancing a matching
power_module. In the case of fir_fsm, the configuration for PKtool analysis and power_module conversion 
have been carried out only for the fir_data module. 
The power_module classes are defined in the header file "power_modules.h".  
For selecting which fir implementation is to be simulated, the user must act on the
macro PK_FIR_RTL defined in the file power_modules.h: commenting/uncommenting
such macro will cause the selection of fir_module/fir_fsm.

The user must select the power model to be applied at the beginning of a PKtool simulation, 
through a specification procedure based on two reading options.
The option 1 requires to specify the model data via a window interaction.  
The option 2 allows to read the model data from a pre-existent configuration file,
which must be formatted in suitable way. 
A More detailed description of this procedure can be found in the PKtool user manual.  
An example of configuration file is reported in the directory "cfg_file"; this file can be 
used for an immediate running of PKtool simulations through the reading option 2. For this 
purpose, the user should do a copy of this file in the top fir directory, where the project 
files are located. The proposed configuration is based on the power_model operators_1,
 which provides energy estimations
given by the sum of the contributions due to the additions and multiplications occurred 
during a simulation. The signals involved in these operations 
have been converted into augmented counterparts, in order to allow operation sampling.
The choice of this model has seemed appropriate, considering the relevant presence of 
additions and multiplications in the fir functionality.
The simulation results will be reported in a text file called "pk_process_body_res" or
"pk_process_body.FirData_res", on the basis of which fir implementation is enabled.






RUNNING THE EXAMPLE 
===================

running the example under Unix
---------------------------------
    
1. set suitable values in the 'Makefile-local' file for the variables
   CXX, LINK, SYSTEMC_PATH, SYSTEMC_TARGET_ARCH, PKTOOL_PATH.
   For this purpose, follow the rules reported in the INSTALL file 
   located in the PKtool top level directory, at the section: 
   'Installation Notes for Unix'-> 'Basic PKtool Installation steps'-> point 2;
   
2. change to the  directory PKtool-2.3.0/examples/PKtool/sysc/fir.
   Make sure that you have writing privileges for this directory.
     
3. type `make' for compiling the example;
     
4. run the example typing './fir' or 'fir'.
	  
 Note: the example will work with the PKtool library installed.





running the example under Windows
---------------------------------


In order to carry out PKtool simulations, the Visual C++ project must be interfaced
with an available SystemC 2.3.1 library.

Go to the "fir" subdirectory and double-click on the .vcproj file 
to launch Visual C++ with the workspace file. 


1. Display the project Property Pages by selecting 'Properties...' from 
   the Project menu. 


2. From the C/C++ tab, select the General properties and type the path to the 
   SystemC header file in the text entry field labeled 'Additional include directories'.
   (In application with SystemC 2.3.1 provided by Accelera, this path  might appear as:
    'YourSystemCReleaseFolder\src'). 
   
   IMPORTANT:
   The path to the PKtool header file is already set (../../../../src); it must not be modified or deleted.

   

3. From the Linker tab, select the General properties and type the path to 
   the SystemC library in the 'Additional Library Directories:' box.
   (In application with SystemC 2.3.1 provided by Accelera, this path might appear 
    as: 'YourSystemCReleaseFolder\msvc80\systemc\debug')
   
   IMPORTANT:
   The path to the PKtool library is already set (..\..\..\..\msvc\PKtool\Debug); it must not be modified or deleted.



4. Click OK

Select 'Build <example>.exe' under the Build menu or press F7 to build the 
example executable.
