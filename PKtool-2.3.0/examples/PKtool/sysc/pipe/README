README for pipe
===================================================================


This example shows the application of PKtool onto a SystemC description 
called "pipe", which has been taken from the examples provided by the 
SystemC 2.3.1 release. More precisely, the pipe example is located in the release directory 
examples\sysc\pipe. In such directory it is possible to find a readme 
file reporting a complete documentation of the pipe system and its functionality. 

PKtool is applied onto the three modules constituting the system, i.e. 
stage_1, stage_2 and stage_3. Each of such modules is replaced by a matching 
power_module in the sc_main function. The power_module classes are defined in the
header file "power_modules.h". The estimation type is set in terms of total commutations. 
The simulation results will be reported in three separate text files called
"pk_stage1_res", "pk_stage2_res" and "pk_stage3_res", respectively related to stage1, 
stage2 and stage3.

The user must select the power model to be applied at the beginning of a PKtool simulation, 
through a specification procedure based on two reading options.
The option 1 requires to specify the model data via a window interaction.  
The option 2 allows to read the model data from a pre-existent configuration file,
which must be formatted in suitable way.
A More detailed description of this procedure can be found in the PKtool user manual.  
An example of configuration file is reported in the directory "cfg_file"; this file can 
be used for an immediate running of PKtool simulations through the reading option 2. 
For this purpose, the user should do a copy of the file in the pipe top directory, where the 
project files are located. 
The proposed configuration is based on the power_model model_2, which provides estimations
proportional to the sum of the total commutations of system signals. For this purpose, the main 
signals of stage_1, stage_2 and stage_3 have been converted into augmented counterparts in order to 
extract their commutations.




RUNNING THE EXAMPLE 
===================

At the present time, this example has been tested only under Windows platforms


running the example under Windows
---------------------------------


In order to carry out PKtool simulations, the Visual C++ project must be interfaced
with an available SystemC 2.3.1 library.

Go to the "pipe" subdirectory and double-click on the .vcproj file 
to launch Visual C++ with the workspace file. 


1. Display the project Property Pages by selecting 'Properties...' from 
   the Project menu. 


2. From the C/C++ tab, select the General properties and type the path to the 
   SystemC header file in the text entry field labeled 'Additional include directories'.
   (In application with SystemC 2.3.1 provided by Accelera, this path  might appear as:
    'YourSystemCReleaseFolder\src').

   IMPORTANT: 
   The path to the PKtool header file is already set (../../../../src); it must not be modified or deleted.


3. From the Linker tab, select the General properties and type the path to 
   the SystemC library in the 'Additional Library Directories:' box.
   (In application with SystemC 2.3.1 provided by Accelera, this path might appear 
    as: 'YourSystemCReleaseFolder\msvc80\systemc\debug')

   IMPORTANT: 
   The path to the PKtool library is already set (..\..\..\..\msvc\PKtool\Debug); it must not be modified or deleted.


4. Click OK

Select 'Build <example>.exe' under the Build menu or press F7 to build the 
example executable.
